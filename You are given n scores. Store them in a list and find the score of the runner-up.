            Problem
            Given the participants’ score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
            Input Format
            The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.
            Constraints
            •	2 ≤  n ≤  1 0
            •	-100 ≤  A[i] ≤ 100
            Output Format
            Print the runner-up score.
            Sample Input 0
            5
            2 3 6 6 5
            Sample Output 0
            5
            Explanation 0
            Given list is [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]. The maximum score is 6, second maximum score is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.
